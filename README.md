# Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing App

This is a **Streamlit** web application that allows users to upload their own dataset and perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Data Visualization**, and **Hypothesis Testing**. The app provides a user-friendly interface for conducting statistical analysis and gaining insights from the data.

## Features

1. **Data Upload**: 
   - Upload a CSV file and preview the first few rows of the dataset.
   - View the dataset dimensions and basic information.

2. **Data Summary**:
   - Generate summary statistics of the uploaded data (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
   - Filter the data based on selected columns and values.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create univariate histograms of selected columns for visual analysis.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Perform statistical tests including:
     - One-way sample t-test
     - Two-sample t-test
     - Oneway ANOVA
   - Interpret test results and determine if the null hypothesis can be rejected based on the selected significance level (alpha).
